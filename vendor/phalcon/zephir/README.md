Zephir - Ze(nd Engine) Ph(p) I(nt)r(mediate) - is a high level language that eases the creation and maintainability
of extensions for PHP. Zephir extensions are exported to C code that can be compiled and optimized by major C compilers
such as gcc/clang/vc++. Functionality is exposed to the PHP language.

Main features:

* Both dynamic/static typing
* Reduced execution overhead compared with full interpretation
* Restricted procedural programming, promoting OOP
* Memory safety
* Ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler to provide predictable performance

Compiler design goals:

* Multi-pass compilation
* Type speculation/inference
* Allow runtime profile-guided optimizations, pseudo-constant propagation and indirect/virtual function inlining

Requirements
------------

To compile zephir-parser:

* [re2c](http://re2c.org/)

To build the PHP extension:

* g++ >= 4.4/clang++ >= 3.x/vc++ 9
* gnu make 3.81 or later
* php development headers and tools

Installation
------------
You can install zephir using composer.
Run `composer require phalcon/zephir`, run `./install` and then run `zephir`
from your `bin-dir`. By default it is `./vendor/bin/zephir`.
You can read more about composer binaries
in it's [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/vendor-binaries.md).

For global installation via composer you can use `composer global require`.
Do not forget add `~/.composer/vendor/bin` into your `$PATH`.

Also you can just clone zephir repository and run `./install`.
For global installation add `-c` flag.

Additional notes on Ubuntu
--------------------------
The following packages are needed in Ubuntu:

* apt-get install re2c libpcre3-dev

Usage
-----
Compile the extension:

```bash
./bin/zephir compile
```
